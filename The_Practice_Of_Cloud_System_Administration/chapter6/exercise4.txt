A. If a load balancer is being used, the system is automatically scalable and resilient. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Justify your answer.

Disagree.
Because the load balancer by itself is not enough to gaurantee resiliency due to the fact that machines operate on different capacities. And if you have a couple of machines running at 80% capacity and if you dont have enough spare machines N + 1 even though the load balancer is being used. It wont prevent service outage in case of a failure.
A load balancer is important to provide resiliencing when used in combination with enough rescources to take the addition load if one machine or more machines go down.
Also, even though you are using a load balacer your service is not necessarily scaling - this would happen if you are actually using your machines at a higher capacity. So you are scaling your service across multiple machines and load balancing the traffic amoung them. If you are using your machines at a lower capacity it would not configure this layout as scaling but it would be for resiliency instead.
