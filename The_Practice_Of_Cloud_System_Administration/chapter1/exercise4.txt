Q: Sometimes a master server does not reply with an answer but instead replies with where the answer can be found. What are the benefits of this method?

A: If the information is very large, it can overload the master server. 

So instead the master will return the location of where the information can be found and the client will go and get it itself. 

The advantage to this is that the master does not become over congested while trying to retrieve data from the leaves. 

Reduces network traffic and reduces the possibility of the master going down.
