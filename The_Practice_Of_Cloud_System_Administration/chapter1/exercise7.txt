Q: What does it mean when a system is loosely coupled? What is the advantage of these systems?

A: A loosely coupled system means that the subsystems in a distributed system work independently of each other. 

This is advantageous because if one sub system stops working the other sub systems continue to work without the one that went down. 

It is also easy to add more sub systems when this architecture is in place or to replace a whole sub system.
