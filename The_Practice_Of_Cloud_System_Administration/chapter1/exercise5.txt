Q: Section 1.4 describes a distributed file system, including an example of how reading terabytes of data would work. How would writing terabytes of data work?

A: If the client has authenticated with master then if the write is significantly large the master will only return the location of where the files 
that the client wants to write to are and the client will write directly to the leaves.
