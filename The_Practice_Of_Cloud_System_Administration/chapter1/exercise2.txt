Q: Describe the three major composition patterns in distributed computing.

A: There are 3 composition patterns in distributed computing. 

We have the
-  load balancer with multiple backends,
-  server with multiple backends and 
-  a server tree.

Load balancer with multiple backend replicas: 

The load balanacer redirects requests to different backends each time. 
There are many different load balancing techniques to handle the load on back end servers. For example round robin, round robin with ratio relevance, least loaded and slow start.

Server with multiple backends: 

For this you can have a server and multiple backends that server a different purpose, like adwords, spell check service, web search and images. 
And they could have replicas as well to improve redundancy and failures. Think about fan out techniques when talking about this answer.

Server tree: 
This scheme multiple servers work cooperatively as one with the root server, the parent server and the leaf servers at the bottom of the tree
