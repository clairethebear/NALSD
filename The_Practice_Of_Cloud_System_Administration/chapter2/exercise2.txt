Q: How is automated configuration typically supported?

A: In some systems the configuration is dynamically updated as the system runs. 

This “state” may be reflected back into the primary configuration file or may be a separate entity. 
It is better to save the state as a text file so that you can make comparisons over time.

An inferior option would be a configuration file that is an opaque binary blob. 
This would not be human readable and difficult to dissect should anything go wrong in the future.

This step may be carried out through an API or by reading and updating a configuration file. 
If a file is used, a locking protocol must exist to prevent both the service and external automation from 
reading the file in an incomplete state and to prevent update collisions.
