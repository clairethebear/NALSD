Q:  Why is design for operations so important?

A: It is important because we need to be able to rely on the components of a system in order for our service
to run efficiently and never have down time.

In order to do this, the dev ops team needs to make important decisions about how to monitor the system, 
how to account for failures and how to create a system that is fault tolerant to make it more resilient as time goes on.

It is essential that the devops team is involved from the beginning to ensure that the operational features
are part of the plan. Otherwise this can become both messy and costly to revert to a more suitable
architecture for the service once it starts to grow.
