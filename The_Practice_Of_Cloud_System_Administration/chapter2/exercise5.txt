Q: Why might you not want to solve an issue by coding the solution yourself?

A: 
We might not know the codebase and workflow well.
Coding standards; devops may not have insight into the coding standards and worklow.
You dont want to give off the impression that if something doesn't get done then you'll just do it yourself, 
otherwise it will never get done again.
