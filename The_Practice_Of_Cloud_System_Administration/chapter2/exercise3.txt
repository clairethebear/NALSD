Q: List the important factors for redundancy through replication.

A: 
Reliability - if one replica goes down we can still serve requests through the others.
Testing - Ability for developers to test with bug-for-bug or slow integration testing.
Scalability - when your service gets more traffic.
Speed - amount of time it takes to search for data, amount of time it takes for the network to retirve intofmration.
Flexibility for devops - for reboots and hotswaps; its easier to accommodate system planned downtime when other replicas can take extra load.
